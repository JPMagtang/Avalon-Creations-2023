        <p>I created Avalon as a space for my digital creations. You can see here the choice pick of my works in software design and development.
          <br /><br />I am originally from the field of design, but the winds led me to software development which I’m equally, if not more, passionate about.
          <br /><br />I greatly appreciate your visit here and please feel free to reach out.</p>
